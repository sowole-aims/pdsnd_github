>**Note**: The orginal project is **fork**  from the Udacity repository so that I can have a **remote** repository in **my** Github account. I cloned this remote repository to my local machine. Later, as a part of the project "I posted my Work on Github", then pushed my proposed changes to the remote repository in my Github account.
